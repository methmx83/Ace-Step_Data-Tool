See `third_party/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` for per-file details and provenance notes. Please keep the following in mind when publishing or contributing:

- Replace the placeholder upstream commit SHAs in `third_party/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` with the exact commit hashes from the upstream repositories when possible. This improves traceability for security and audits.
- Retain original copyright and license headers in any copied files. Do not remove or alter these headers.
- For any file you modify that originated in an upstream Apache-2.0 project, add a short header comment that states the original source, the upstream commit SHA (if known), a brief summary of your modifications, and the Apache-2.0 license reference.

If you are a copyright owner and require changes to attribution, or if you need help locating the upstream commit SHAs, please open an issue.
